# MachineLearning

This repository draws attention to simple machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent and Principal Component Analysis. The two latter algorithms can be found in the "algorithms.py" file, whereas the two former models are implemented in the files "linear_model.py" and "non_linear_model.py". Loss functions and evaluation metrices can be found in the respective files.

For each of the machine learning algorithms I created a distinct class, making use of Python's neat object oriented programming features.
